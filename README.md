<p>I've builded this project when i was learning Jquery.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>You can play the game in this <a href="https://kalkay-simon-game.netlify.app/" target="_blank"> link </a>
<p>Users need to press a random key for starting the game <br/> <br/>
When the game starts a random box starts glowing up and fades away in time. If users click on the correct box they'll earn points, if they click on the wrong boxes they'll lose points.
